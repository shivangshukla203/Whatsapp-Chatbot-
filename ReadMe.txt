This code implements a WhatsApp chatbot using the Baileys library for connecting to WhatsApp and the Groq SDK for AI-based responses. Here's an overview of the functionality and features:

WhatsApp Connection:

The bot uses Baileys to connect to WhatsApp via a multi-file authentication system, ensuring secure and persistent session handling.
It fetches the latest version of Baileys and establishes a socket connection.
When the bot starts, it generates a QR code in the terminal for user login via WhatsApp.
Groq API Integration:

The chatbot leverages the Groq SDK to access an AI model (llama3-8b-8192) for generating responses.
Upon receiving a message, it queries the Groq API, sending the user’s input and fetching a reply based on the model’s completion.
Message Handling:

The bot listens for incoming messages using Baileys' event system (messages.upsert).
It checks if the message is from a user (not sent by the bot itself) and processes only plain text messages.
For each user message, it queries the Groq API for a response and sends the generated reply back to the user.
Persistent Session & Reconnection:

The bot saves credentials securely using useMultiFileAuthState, allowing it to maintain the session even after restarts.
It automatically attempts to reconnect if the connection is lost, except when explicitly logged out by the user.
